                    We are a proud-standing airline, that has vowed to always offer the best comfort and service on-board our planes.
                    <br>
                    Chao Air&trade; was founded during the summer season of 2025 with the help of our parent company Sonic&trade; Team, and from there we started our jurney releasing the first Chao Air&trade; airliner; The A320-200 "Neutral Chao" (EI-CHA), sadly not operative anymore.
                    <br>
                    We then chose that the standard for our fleet was to be registred in Ireland for reducing costs.
                    <br>
                    Thereafter, we began flying European routes, for example from Milan Malpensa (LIMC) to Copenhagen Kastrup (EKCH) with an encreasing amount of aircrafts with their own passion-crafted liveries. Various of them depicting Sonic The Hedgehog&trade; characters.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once our fleet was initialized, we became quite popular in Italy and Switzerland, bringing up the need to created country-based liveries, for example an Italian one - this idea is still a working progress, so things can change at any moment.
                    <br>
                    We are working on a lot of additions for the airline, and we have just started our enterprise's journey.
                    <br>
                    In conclusion, we wouldn't be here without the help from donations and fans, we are very thankfull for all of you!
